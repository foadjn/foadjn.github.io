I am an M.Sc. student in computer science at Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany. I am interested in applied and fundamental causal inference.

Before starting my master's studies, I did my bachelor's in computer science at Sharif University of Technology, where I worked on machine learning, probabilistic graphical model, and parallel computing.
